# Conway's Game of Life

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

It simulates life with single-celled organisms reproducing and dying depending on the density of the population (measured by if the neigbbouring cells are dead or alive). This can create various interesting patterns.

## To run
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## To play
1. Click anywhere on the board to set your initial settings.
2. Click run and watch the cells reproduce or die.
3. The board is set to update every 200 miliseconds. Feel free to change the value if you want to speed up or slow down the game.
4. The "Random" button randomizes the board, in case you do not wish to spend time clicking on the board.
5. The "Clear" button wipes the board clean, leaving you with an empty board.
